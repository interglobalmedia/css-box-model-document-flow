Pre Class Session 5 March 2, 2021  Notes 

New tools to use to improve your site:

1. [a11y Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/) (WCAG 2.1 AA SC 1.4.3 Test for Color Contrast): Also referred to as "A11y" and "A11Y," a11y is an abbreviation for "accessibility" that is more compact for the character limits on social media. The “11” in the middle stems from conventions in software engineering and Information and Communication Technology that shortens long words by substituting middle letters with the number of middle letters instead. There are 11 letters between the "a" and the "y," so accessibility becomes a11y. For another example, “l10n” refers to "localization," because 10 letters come between the “l” and the “n.”

Coincidentally, a11y looks like it would read phonetically as ally, which has been the topic of controversy in some circles on social media.

No less, many technologists see a11y as a movement, and not just the simple act of making websites more accessible. To learn more about a11y, please visit [What is a11y?](https://www.boia.org/blog/what-is-a11y#:~:text=May%204%2C%202017,character%20limits%20on%20social%20media.).

2. [W3C HTML Markup validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri+with_options) - validates your HTML markup (and more)

3. Lighthouse Chrome Extension (I mentioned this before, but it really is an essential tool for web design and development today): even lets you know what is wrong or not semantic about your HTML markup.

I have uploaded my portfolio.html page (along with my other "dummy pages") to my domain name on Namecheap. I made a few changes afterwards, and this is what it looks like now: [letsbsocial.nyc](https://www.letsbsocial.nyc/portfolio.html)

Please be sure to also check out the HTML markup and CSS code changes I made available for viewing on the [Sectioning HTML](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/sectioning-html) slide deck repository on Github.

if there is anything else I can think of before class on Tuesday, March 2, 2021, I will add it here. Thanks!
